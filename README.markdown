This is a writeup of the initial code from Brett Schuchert’s talk on how to work with legacy code at Vimeo, <http://vimeo.com/34484105>.

Watch the talk.

You can also read "[A story about too much power](http://schuchert.wikispaces.com/JMockIt.AStoryAboutTooMuchPower)" in order to understand the motivation for this example.


# Setup

The example requires Moq and Typemock Isolator libraries to be present in the `lib` folder of the project. Neither library is provided. [Moq][] is open-source. [Typemock Isolator][] is a commercial product, with evaluation and educational licenses available.
